# Ant Template with Hibernate for CloudBees.

## Note before deploying this on JBoss 7:

There are configuration changes to do in the following file, comments will indicate which lines to change and how.

    src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml

## To build and deploy this on CloudBees, follow those steps:

Create application:

    bees app:create MYAPP_ID

Create database:

    bees db:create -u DB_USER -p DB_PASSWORD DBNAME

Bind database as datasource:

    bees app:bind -db DBNAME -a MYAPP_ID -as ExampleDS

Create a new software project in Jenkins, changing the following:

* Add this git repository (or yours, with this code) on Jenkins
* In build, Add build step -> Invoke Ant with no target.
* Also check "Deploy to CloudBees" with those parameters:

        Applications: First Match
        Application Id: MYAPP_ID
        Filename Pattern: target/*.war

* Optionally change the application container to Java EE, if you wish to deploy on JBoss. 

## To build this locally:

In the ant_template directory, open a command line, and invoke ant by typing "ant" to build the war file, then deploy it on cloudbees typing:

    bees app:deploy -t tomcat -a MYAPP_ID target/*.war

Or, for JBoss:

    bees app:deploy -t jboss -a MYAPP_ID target/*.war

## To deploy this locally:

Make sure you have a MySQL database bound to java:comp/env/jdbc/ExampleDS, and then deploy in your favorite container.
